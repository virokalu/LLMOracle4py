If the height is 1, then a single disk is located at peg 1, it must be placed at peg 3.

So moveDisk(0, 1, 2) is [], then moveDisk(1, 1, 3) is [(1,3)], then moveDisk(0, 2, 3) is []. So final solution is [(1,3)]. In order to generate the moves required by the test, where it outputs (1,2), the actual function requires the positions to be swapped. By switching end to be aux, and aux to be end. So the real recursive process can be explained as follow moveDisk(1, 1, 3) is moveDisk(0, 1, 3) then (1,2) then moveDisk(0, 3, 3).

Value 1: We cannot take 31 due to knapsack, thus no more than 70.

[20,39] and [19,37] is 76 so we can make a bit better

[80, 64] + [64, 46] equals 144 and 110. and cap 190

Now if the algorithm is maximizing towards item with highest value. Then we consider the values and use as many as possible. Start with item with weight 56, 50. Then consider the next which is 59. the weight becomes 115, the value is now 100. now with all these we should check if exceeds value 146, which means algorithm is wrong. And we can conclude. 

Here is a step: 80,64 and what's next with less weight from the front? we can choose. 56. and value total is 134, then the remaining capacity must fit another number with val. choose 17.

[64, 46] + 8. [56+8+75=190 max ]. equals cap, val +[  64val . can optimize val? all are very close in weight.
