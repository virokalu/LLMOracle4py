        INPUT ANALYSIS:
- Parameter details:
  * text: The leaves did not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings - the sea, mountains, clouds, the open sky - Gurov thought how in reality everything is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our existence. (should be The starting text.)
  * cols: 140 (should be The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.)

OUTPUT VALIDATION:
- Expected output description: An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text

Consider: Does this output make sense given the inputs and function purpose?

DEEPER ANALYSIS:

PRECONDITIONS:
- cols > 0.
Verify if these conditions were met before execution.

VERIFICATION TASK:
        1. First analyze whether the function behaved correctly
        2. If incorrect, return false in response and identify the most likely cause
        3. Suggest specific fixes or tests to validate your hypothesis
        4. Rate confidence in your assessment (Low/Medium/High)

            }
          },
          ""required"": [""response""]
        }",True,The text is wrapped correctly. The string's lengths are less than or equal to the specified column length of 140 and also it seems the text strings are concatented.,No suggestions,False,False
