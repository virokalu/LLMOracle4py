Follow this reasoning process:
1. SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS: 
   - Extract the function's purpose from the metadata.
2. INPUT VALIDATION:
   - Verify if inputs match the described types/ranges.
3. OUTPUT ANALYSIS:
   - Compare actual vs. expected output byte-for-byte if primitive, or structure-for-structure if complex.
   - Do not be misled by the output descriptions provided by the functions rather than the expected output.
4. ERROR DIAGNOSIS (if applicable):
   - Classify the error (logical, runtime, precondition violation).
5. CONCLUSION:
   - Binary correctness judgment (True/False) with technical rationale.
        INPUT ANALYSIS:
- Parameter details:
  * text: The leaves did not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings - the sea, mountains, clouds, the open sky - Gurov thought how in reality everything is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our existence. (should be The starting text.)
  * cols: 140 (should be The target column width, i.e. the maximum length of any single line after wrapping.)

OUTPUT VALIDATION:
- Expected output description: An ordered list of strings, each no longer than the column width, such that the concatenation of the strings returns the original text,
and such that no word in the original text is broken into two parts unless necessary.  The original amount of spaces are preserved (e.g. spaces
at the start or end of each line aren't trimmed.),Wrapping Text

Consider: Does this output make sense given the inputs and function purpose? If it is not, return false.

DEEPER ANALYSIS:

PRECONDITIONS:
- cols > 0.
Verify if these conditions were met before execution.

VERIFICATION TASK:
        1. First analyze whether the function behaved correctly
        2. If incorrect, return false in response and identify the most likely cause
        3. Suggest specific fixes or tests to validate your hypothesis
        4. Rate confidence in your assessment (Low/Medium/High)

        Final Answer Format:
        {
          ""properties"": {
            ""response"": {
              ""type"": ""boolean""
            },
            ""suggestions"": {
              ""type"": ""string""
            },
            ""reasons"": {
              ""type"": ""string""
            }
          },
          ""required"": [""response""]
        }
    - Could malformed inputs produce this output? If it is, return false.
    - Is there a hidden edge case (e.g., null inputs, overflow)? If it is, return false.
    - Does the output violate any invariants? If it is, return false.
    - Review your analysis to ensure it is logically consistent. - Identify any uncertainties 
    regarding the function's specifications. - Verify if the output provided in the prompt is simply a description or 
    the actual required output. If it is not, return false.",False,"With a column width of 140, all strings can be less than length of 140 with word wrap. With length is 1102, the total number of characters should at least have near that number which needs to be a check that's being requested here, not this. Therefore i must reject. It can't even concat which makes text.","It could have been caused by inefficient text processing routines but without tests in code, check is essential",False,True
